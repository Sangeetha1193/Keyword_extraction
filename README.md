# Keyword_extraction
This project focuses on extracting the most relevant keywords from a given text document using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to obtain the most useful key terms that best capture the content of the document, which can be applied to indexing, search engine optimization (SEO), summarization, or content tagging.
